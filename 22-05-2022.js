/* 8 Kyu - A Needle in the Haystack

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

findNeedle(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'hay', 'moreJunk', 'needle', 'randomJunk'])
should return "found the needle at position 5" (in COBOL "found the needle at position 6")

*/

//SOLUTION 


function findNeedle(haystack) {
    return `found the needle at position ${haystack.indexOf('needle')}`
  }

//SOLUTION
