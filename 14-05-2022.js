/* 7 Kyu - You're a square!

A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false

//SOLUTION 


var isSquare = function(n){
    return n === - 1 ? false : Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0 ? true : false
  }



/* 8 Kyu - Grasshopper - Check for factor

This function should test if the factor is a factor of base.

Return true if it is a factor or false if it is not.

About factors
Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.

2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: 2 * 3 = 6

You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.
You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a remainder
For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1

Note: base is a non-negative number, factor is a positive number.

//SOLUTION 


function checkForFactor (base, factor) {
    return base%factor === 0 ? true : false;
  }
