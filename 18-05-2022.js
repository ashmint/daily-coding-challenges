/* 6 Kyu - Find the odd int

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

//SOLUTION 

function findOdd(A) {
    let l
    A.forEach(x => (A.filter(y => y === x).length) % 2 !== 0 ? l = x : l = l)
    return l
  }


/* 8 Kyu - Welcome!


Your start-up's BA has told marketing that your website has a large audience in Scandinavia and surrounding countries. Marketing thinks it would be great to welcome visitors to the site in their own language. Luckily you already use an API that detects the user's location, so this is an easy win.

The Task
Think of a way to store the languages as a database (eg an object). The languages are listed below so you can copy and paste!
Write a 'welcome' function that takes a parameter 'language' (always a string), and returns a greeting - if you have it in your database. It should default to English if the language is not in the database, or in the event of an invalid input.
The Database
english: 'Welcome',
czech: 'Vitejte',
danish: 'Velkomst',
dutch: 'Welkom',
estonian: 'Tere tulemast',
finnish: 'Tervetuloa',
flemish: 'Welgekomen',
french: 'Bienvenue',
german: 'Willkommen',
irish: 'Failte',
italian: 'Benvenuto',
latvian: 'Gaidits',
lithuanian: 'Laukiamas',
polish: 'Witamy',
spanish: 'Bienvenido',
swedish: 'Valkommen',
welsh: 'Croeso'
